This Unity project features a stylized rover scene designed to experiment with **cel shading techniques** and explore the rendering limits of Unity's **Built-in Render Pipeline (BiRP)**.
It uses the **Stylized Cel Shader (SCS)** by [Symmasolan](https://symmasolan.itch.io), a PBR-lite shader that supports toon-like shading with outline effects and real-time lighting support.

## Features

- Stylized cel-shaded lighting with support for normal, metallic, and emissive maps  
- PBR-lite surface options including height, occlusion, and transparency  
- Basic outline rendering using reverse hull (outline works in Forward rendering mode)  
- Real-time and baked lighting support via Ambient Spherical Harmonics  
- Highly customizable per material using LWGUI (clean and user-friendly inspector)
